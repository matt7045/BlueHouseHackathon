# BlueHouseHackathon

## Overview
This is a learning project, that leverages the free Alpaca paper trading API, and Google's KERAS deep learning framework, in an attempt to classify market days as profitable, or unprofitable, dependent on data from the previous days.

# Getting Started
To get started, make sure you have:
1. **Python 3.9.x_.** Download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **KERAS Deep Learning framework.** Install it via the console command `python -m pip install Keras`. This framework is needed to run machine learning securities.
3. **An Account with Alpaca**. This brokerage offers a free paper-trading API, which is used extensively throughout the project. An account can be made for free at https://app.alpaca.markets/signup.
